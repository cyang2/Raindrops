Raindrops Game

Your goal is to catch raindrops that fall from the sky using the catcher object, which follows your mouse's position.

Points are scored by catching raindrops.

When the score reaches 5, you will move onto the next level and the raindrops will fall faster (1 more pixel per frame).

When the score reaches -5, **YOU LOSE!**
